This repository contains all the embedded software written for our custom circuit boards on the racecar.
It is organized by platform: e.g. 2020 means WUFR-20, 2018 means BFR-18, etc.
Model years before the present should be considered to be frozen, unless that year's car is scheduled for further testing.
